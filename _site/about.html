<p>Hey all, this is my blog! It’s just a small project I want to build in my free time. My goal is to write and share photos about different (and RANDOM) things happening in my life. English was always a subject I enjoyed in school and I loved the challenge of having to write essays to communicate my ideas. However, as an engineering student now, it’s very rare that I am expected to write anything at all! My hope is that this blog can be an outlet for me to keep writing, and to enjoy writing.</p>
